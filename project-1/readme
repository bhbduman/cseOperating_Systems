    To keep shell code simple i used a0 so before you make syscall you should load approproate number into $a0 register(1:Showprimes, 2:Factorize, 3:Bubblesort) so according to numbers i run related file. Then you should make syscall with 18 within $v0
you can find the explanation in syscall.cpp file

USAGE:
    I defined new process CREATE_PROCESS_SYSCALL in header as 18
    I did not change makefile.
    You just need to put asm files and syscall.cpp into related places
    $make command
    ./spim -file shell.asm

You will face with a menu I printed enough information as many i could
You should just follow the instructions
